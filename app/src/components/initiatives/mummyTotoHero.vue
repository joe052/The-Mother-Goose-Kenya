            That breastfeeding has cognitive and health benefits for both
            infants and their mothers. The breastfeed infants have high IQ, have
            increased immunity, have less risk of SIDs, Diabetes, ADHD and
            Leukaemia. Mothers who breastfeed have a reduced risk of ovarian and
            breast cancer, which are two leading causes of death among women.

            Of the new moms that begin breastfeeding annually, only 61% make it
            to the recommended exclusive breastfeeding milestone of six months.

            6 months exclusive breastfeeding.

            Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is very important to the child
            and the mother as it is known to improve the health status of both
            mother and child, as well as impact positively the entire early
            years development of the child, which is a good foundation for the
            later years. The Mother Goose Kenya is in the forefront to campaign
            for the exclusive breastfeeding, by offering various solutions that
            could support mothers in the 6 months exlusive breastfeeding. Our
            aim is to see that children have a healthy and good start in life
            and that the mothers can breastfeed their babies whenever and
            wherever they want. Our main solution in support of breastfeeding is
            creation of Breastfeeding stations in workplaces and in public
            places that could be used by any breastfeeding mother at no cost, to
            express her milk or nurse her child whenever she needs to do it. The
            breastfeeding stations are made to meet the requirements of the Law
            as per the Health Act 2017 and the awaiting to be law bill; The
            Breastfeeding Mother Bill 2017. We also offer Breastfeeding classes
            to Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in order to educate them on
            importance of exclusive breastfeeding and how to breastfeed in the
            right way.

            Challenges the breastfeeding mothers are facing
          </h1>
          <p class="text-base mt-5 text-gray-700 p-10">
            More than 90% of the mothers who start breastfeeding after birth,
            only 60% make it to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the
            mothers that return to work after the 3 months maternity leave are
            unable to feed their babies with their breastmilk because they lack
            conducive places whereby they can express their milk. Even with the
            current Health Act 2017, more than 95% of working nursing mothers
            are yet to get the support of their employer to provide
            breastfeeding stations at work. The Breastfeeding stations at
            workplaces could in future be implemented in only the formal
            employment because breastfeeding Bill requires the employers with
            more than thirty women employees to set the breastfeeding stations
            and that would benefit about 20% of working mothers. However, the
            working mothers in the informal sector in Kenya which represent 83.4
            % of the employment as per Kenya National Bureau of Statistics of
            2017, might not get the support to breastfeed after the maternity
            leave. Therefore, the target of the Kenyan government to have more
            than 90% of mother successfully do 6 months exclusive breastfeeding
            might not be realized.
